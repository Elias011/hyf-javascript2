Go to https://api.github.com/orgs/HackYourFuture/repos, you will see a list of the repositories our HYF organization has (yes it's a lot of JSON).
You can copy the JSON and put it in a string at the top of your .js file. Print the name of the 3rd repository in the array to the console.
Make a <ul> with a <li> for each repository name (just like you did with the books in the previous assignment).
It should only display the modules that are actually being used in the curriculum at the moment, you of course know which those are, but if you need a reminder you can find them in our curriculum overview.
Use CSS to divide the page in two columns. The left column will have a list of the names for repository. The right column should have the following information about each repository: the number of stargazers, the number of watchers, the number of forks, the language of the repository.
place the avatar_url (logo) of our organization somewhere on a nice place in your page.
