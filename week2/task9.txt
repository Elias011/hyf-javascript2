Here are two functions that look like they do the something similar but they print different results. Please explain what's going on here.
var x = 9; 
function f1(val) { 
    val = val+1; 
    return val;
}
f1(x);
console.log(x);


var y = { x: 9 };
function f2(val) {
    val.x = val.x + 1;
    return val;
}
f2(y);
console.log(y);
*************
JavaScript processes all variable declarations before executing any code,
whether the declaration is inside a conditional block or other construct.
Once JavaScript has found all the variables, it executes the code in the function. 
If a variable is implicitly declared inside a function - that is, 
if it appears on the left side of an assignment expression but has not been declared with var - it is created as a global variable.
