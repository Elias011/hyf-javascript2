JavaScript processes all variable declarations before executing any code,
whether the declaration is inside a conditional block or other construct.
Once JavaScript has found all the variables, it executes the code in the function. 
If a variable is implicitly declared inside a function - that is, 
if it appears on the left side of an assignment expression but has not been declared with var - it is created as a global variable.
